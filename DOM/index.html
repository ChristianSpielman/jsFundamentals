    <title>Intro to DOM Manipulation</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!--DOM stands for Document Object Model, and is what allows our JS to interact with the HTML and CSS of our page.
    the DOM specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML pace and how JS can access and update the contents
    of a page while it is in the browse'rs window.

    Dom is an object representation of a web page, which can be modified with a scripting language like JS

    Two primary functions:
    1. Making a model of an HTML page
        -when the browser loads a webpage it creates a model of the page in memory
        -the DOM specifies the way in which the browser should structure the model
            in what is called the DOM tree. The DOM is called an object model because the 
            DOM tree is made of Objects.
    2.Accessing and changing the HTML page
        -the DOM also provides methods and properties to access and update each object
    in the model, which in turn updates what the user sees in the browser.

    Usually when working with the DOM tree, we will access and element we want to work
        with and then we will modify or manipulate it.
    
    Accessing:
        Common methods for accessing a single element
            -getElementById()
            -querySelector()
        Common methods for Accessing multiple Elements
            -querySelectorAll()
            -getElementByClassName()
            -getElementByTagName()
    Manipulating:
        Common Methods for working  with html content
            -innerHTML
            -textContent
            -createElement
        Common methods for working with Tag attributes
            -className / id
            -setAttribute()
            -getAttribute()
            -->

    <!--1-->
    <p id="testParagraph">Sample Text</p>

    <p class="sampleClass">A class paragraph</p>
    <p class="sampleClass">A class paragraph</p>
    <p class="sampleClass">A class paragraph</p>
    <p class="sampleClass">A class paragraph</p>
    <h2 class="sampleClass">An h2 example</h2>
    <hr  />
<!--2-->
    <span id="spanTest">Hello<span style="display: none">World</span></span>
    <br  />
    <hr  />
    
    <!--3-->
    <button id="clickThis">Click!</button>
    <br/>
    <hr/>

    <!--4-->
    <label for="nameInput">Enter your name:</label> <br/>
    <input type="text" id="nameInput" placeholder="Your Name Here"/>

    <!-- We can write javascript directly in our html page by typing it within a <script> tag,
        similar to how we would write css in a <style> tag  -->
    
    <script>
        console.log('Hello form the script tag~!');//What if we want to use an external javascript file in this webpage?
    
        </script>

    <script src ='script.js'></script>
